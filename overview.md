## Introduction
Program in Python _to execute regular expressions on strings using an algorithm known as Thompsonâ€™s construction. Thompsons' construction is used to convert a regular expression to a NFA. This NFA is then used to match a String against the original regular expression. The main goal of this project is to accept a regular expression with the special characters to match it against an input string from the user.
